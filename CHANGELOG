Heroku Rails

v0.2.0
============================================
Added Heroku Settings tasks, and rails generators

Cleaned out lots of tasks that are now handled by editing config/heroku.yml and running `rake heroku:setup`

Namespaced tasks such as heroku:deploy, heroku:console, etc. The only top level task now is `rake all ...` which sets all the environments. Individual environment tasks (e.g. `rake production ...`) are still generated without a namespace.
